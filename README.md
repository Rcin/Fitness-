# Fitness+
Fitness+ is a multifunctional fitness program done by Processing and Arduino that helps you achieve your fitness plan every day. It is not just a fitness application but also an information station and a music player.

This is the final project for Cindy Hu and Yimin Wang's Interaction Lab course as well as Cindy Hu's Expressing Data course.
